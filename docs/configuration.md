# Configuration

Everything lives in `.brownie/settings.json` — a nested JSON that's strictly validated, so a typo'd key fails with a named path instead of being silently ignored. The first `brownie` run asks only for the two agent prompts and writes an empty settings file — every setting starts with its default. Change them at runtime with the slash commands below or edit the file by hand (picked up on the next start).

Every section is optional — `{}` is a valid file. A typical setup:

```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "model": "haiku",
    "intervalMinutes": 15,
    "activeHours": "08:00-18:00",
    "activeDays": "mon-fri"
  },
  "executor": {
    "model": "opus",
    "effort": "high",
    "sessionTimeoutMs": 1800000
  }
}
```

## All settings

| Key                           | Default          | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `monitor.model`               | `haiku`          | monitor model                                           |
| `monitor.effort`              | `medium`         | monitor effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `monitor.intervalMinutes`     | `15`             | patrol interval (fractions allowed)                     |
| `monitor.activeHours`         | _(24/7)_         | working window, e.g. `08:00-18:00`                      |
| `monitor.activeDays`          | _(daily)_        | working days, e.g. `mon-fri` or `mon,wed,sat-sun`       |
| `monitor.sessionTimeoutMs`    | _(none)_         | monitor session timeout                                 |
| `executor.model`              | `opus`           | executor model                                          |
| `executor.effort`             | `high`           | executor effort                                         |
| `executor.sessionTimeoutMs`   | _(none)_         | executor session timeout                                |
| `executor.maxTaskAttempts`    | `3`              | max attempts per task (transient failures are retried)  |
| `executor.retryDelayMs`       | `30000`          | delay between attempts                                  |
| `summarizer.model`            | `sonnet`         | summarizer model                                        |
| `summarizer.effort`           | `medium`         | summarizer effort                                       |
| `summarizer.sessionTimeoutMs` | `300000` (5 min) | summarizer session timeout                              |
| `streamPartial`               | `true`           | stream partial responses to the dashboard               |

## Changing settings at runtime

The dashboard exposes the everyday settings as slash commands — each one validates the value, persists it to `.brownie/settings.json`, and applies it live, so the **next agent session** already uses it (a running session finishes on the old values, no restart needed):

| Command                     | Setting                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/model <agent> <model>`    | `monitor.model`, `executor.model`, `summarizer.model`    |
| `/effort <agent> <level>`   | `monitor.effort`, `executor.effort`, `summarizer.effort` |
| `/interval <minutes>`       | `monitor.intervalMinutes`                                |
| `/hours <HH:MM-HH:MM\|off>` | `monitor.activeHours` (`off` clears it)                  |
| `/days <days\|off>`         | `monitor.activeDays` (`off` clears it)                   |
| `/config`                   | shows all current values                                 |

The remaining keys (`streamPartial`, `sessionTimeoutMs`, `maxTaskAttempts`, `retryDelayMs`) are edited by hand and picked up on the next start. The agent prompts are also editable in place — `/prompt <monitor|executor>` opens them in the dashboard editor ([docs/prompts.md](prompts.md)).

## Working hours

The monitor patrols only inside the configured window; outside it the loop sleeps until the next opening. The executor is not limited by the window — it finishes whatever is already in the queue.

- `activeHours` — `HH:MM-HH:MM`, e.g. `08:00-18:00`. Overnight windows work too: `22:00-06:00`.
- `activeDays` — day tokens `mon`…`sun`, as ranges and/or a comma-separated list: `mon-fri`, `sat-sun`, `mon,wed,fri`, `fri-mon`.

## Timeouts and retries

- `sessionTimeoutMs` kills a stuck session (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 5 s). A timeout counts as a **transient** failure.
- The executor retries transient failures (timeouts, known error patterns in the result) up to `maxTaskAttempts` with `retryDelayMs` between attempts; permanent failures mark the task `failed` right away. Failed tasks can be requeued from the TUI with `/retry <task-id>`.

## The `.brownie/` directory

Like Claude Code's `.claude/`, brownie keeps all per-project state in `.brownie/` inside the directory you run it from:

```
your-project/
└── .brownie/
    ├── settings.json              # configuration (validated with zod)
    ├── .gitignore                 # ignores data/ and logs/ (written once by the wizard)
    ├── prompts/
    │   ├── monitor.prompt.md      # what the monitor should check on every patrol
    │   └── executor.prompt.md     # who the executor is and how it works
    ├── data/
    │   ├── tasks.json             # task queue (atomic writes)
    │   └── memory.db              # long-term memory (SQLite + FTS5)
    └── logs/                      # session logs: <agent>/<day>/<hour>_<sessionId>.log
```

Commit `settings.json` and `prompts/` if your team shares them — `data/` and `logs/` are runtime state, ignored automatically via the wizard-written `.brownie/.gitignore`.

Tasks live in `data/tasks.json`; tasks stuck `in_progress` after a crash are reset to `pending` on the next start. Every session is also written to a persistent log under `logs/`, so you can always read back what an agent actually did.
